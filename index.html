  				<h1> About Me </h1>
				I am a sociable, meticulous student with an excellent ability to multi-task and demonstrate great resistance to stress. 
				I have skills in the fields of finance, public relations, and computer science. </br></br>
				I am 24 years old and currently in my second year of Ph.D. in computer sciences at Rennes 1 University and Inria laboratory.  
				My thesis is about the Automatic Construction of Explanations for AI Models. 
				My supervisors are Christine Largouët and Luis Galarraga from the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/lacodam/">LACODAM</a> team. </br></br>
				Due to recent advances in AI and in particular in deep learning, models are becoming more and more difficult to trust since their success is often due to their high complexity. 
				Relying on the answers of a black box can be an issue for technical, ethical, and legal reasons. 
				The purpose of my Ph.D. is to extend actual interpretable methods for machine learning methods to explain the inner mechanisms of a complex machine model. </br></br>
				During the first part of my Ph.D., 
				I studied the generation of post-hoc local explanation and proposed two frameworks to select a priori the best surrogate model for tabular and text data.
				Next, I am searching to collaborate with international researchers from another laboratory or company to study more in detail the impact of the surrogate model 
				on human understandability.
				My projects are about integrating the user in the loop for interpretability (or what I want to call Activate Interpretability Learning) 
				or conducting user studies to evaluate the impact of the chosen explanation model.</br></br>
				If you are interested in collaboration, don't hesitate to send an email!</br>

				<h1>Work experience</h1>
				<h2>2020 - </h2>
				<li>PhD student supervised by <a href="http://people.irisa.fr/Christine.Largouet/">Christine largouët</a> and <a href="http://luisgalarraga.de/">Luis Galarraga</a> in the domain of interpretability</li>
				<div class="description">  The recently approved GDPR contemplates the right of individuals to contest decisions made on their personal data. 
						That encompasses decisions made by algorithms. To select the most suitable explanation for a use case taking into account criteria such as fidelity, 
						complexity, scope, semantics, and the target user. Such a task is far from trivial because it requires a knowledge of the guarantees of the different
						explanation methods, as well as an analysis of the context in which the explanation will be delivered. </br>
						This task is time-consuming and unfeasible for non-technical users. We argue, however, that it can be automated.</br>
				</div>
  				<h2>2020</h2>
  				<li> 6 months internship in Lacodam team supervised by <a href="http://luisgalarraga.de/">Luis Galarraga</a> and <a href="http://people.irisa.fr/Christine.Largouet/">Christine largouët</a></li>
  					<div class="description">I complete my research master's degree with a second internship in a research laboratory. 
						  This internship was part of the FABLE project (that leads to my PhD thesis.) 
						  The purposes was to think and solve the question: "when are anchors based explanation not a good idea?" 
						  I firstly studyied <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf">Anchors</a>, a local interpretability method based on
						  decision rules introduced by Marco Tulio Ribeiro, the author of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">Lime.</a> 
						  I discovered for tabular data that the discretization method employed by LIME and Anchors impact their fidelity of the black box model and 
						  I proposed a better discretization method to improve these methods.</br>
						  Furthermore, I extended the latent research space used by Anchors to generate textual explanation by incorporating 
						  <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7340-explanations-based-on-the-missing-towards-contrastive-explanations-with-pertinent-negatives.pdf">pertinent negatives.</a> 
						  This internship ended with the publication of our work in the international conference <a href="https://www.cikm2020.org/">CIKM 2020.</a> 
					</div>
  				<h2>2019</h2>
  				<li>In charge of communication for the association of resident of Sherbrooke University. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/assoResidencesSherbrooke/">Agrus</a></li>
  					<div class="description">I was in charge of the communication of an association with more than 500 adherent members. I created and organized events 
						  through spreading them on social networks and communication with responsible. 
						  I also took part to the organization of some events such as visiting a sugar shack or the winter carnaval in Québec.</div>
  				<h2>2018</h2>
  				<li> 4 months internship in Lacodam team supervised by <a href="http://luisgalarraga.de/">Luis Galarraga</a> </li>
				  	<div class="description">
						I complete my university degree with an internship in a research laboratory. This was my first foot in the research, and I never leave it after.
						This internship ended with the writing of an article concerning the mining of referring expressions published in the international conference 
						<a href="https://diku-dk.github.io/edbticdt2020/"> EDBT 2020.</a>. 
						During this internship I coded a programm called REMI, supervised by Luis Galarraga. </br> 
						A referring expression (RE) is a description that identifies a set of instances unambiguously. 
						Mining REs from data finds applications in natural language generation, algorithmic journalism, and data maintenance. 
						Since there may exist multiple REs for a given set of entities, it is common to focus on the most intuitive ones, i.e., the most concise and informative. 
						REMI is a system that can mine intuitive REs on large RDF knowledge bases.

  				<div class="description">During two years, I work as a student job in the library of Rennes Metropole, where is also located the Museum of Brittany, the Sciences Space and a conference hall. 
					  I did public service, organized and sorted the books. Finally, I was in charge of the reception of the visitors. </div>

  				<h1> About Me </h1>
				I am a 27-year-old researcher who recently earned a Ph.D., having successfully defended my thesis at Inria Rennes in France. As a sociable and meticulous person, I bring forth exceptional multitasking abilities and a demonstrated resilience to high-stress situations.</br></br>
				My expertise lies in the fields of <strong>explainability</strong> (XAI), <strong>natural language processing</strong> (NLP), and <strong>human-computer interaction</strong> (HCI). During my doctoral research, conducted under the guidance of <a href="http://people.irisa.fr/Christine.Largouet/">Christine Largouët</a> and <a href="http://luisgalarraga.de/">Luis Galárraga</a> from the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/lacodam/">LACODAM</a> team, I focused on Explainability for Machine Learning Models: From Data Adaptability to User Perception</br></br>

				In the current landscape of advanced AI, particularly in deep learning, the escalating complexity of models raises concerns about trust. Relying on <strong>black-box</strong> solutions poses challenges for technical, ethical, and legal reasons. My Ph.D. aimed to address these issues by extending <strong>interpretable</strong> methods for machine learning, shedding light on the inner mechanisms of complex models.</br></br>

				Since gaining experience in utilizing techniques such as generating artificial instances to strengthen explanations during my Ph.D., I am enthusiastic to employ and expand upon these competencies within a <strong>professional</strong> environment at <a href="https://www.topdoctors.es/">Top Doctors</a>. I look forward to discovering opportunities to make substantial contributions and drive developments in the domain of <strong>generative AI</strong>, with a concentrated emphasis on NLP, capitalizing on my newly acquired role.</br></br>

				<li>Researcher in Natural Language Processing (NLP) specializing in AI at <a href="https://www.topdoctors.es/">Top Doctors</a>, Barcelona</li>
				<div class="description">  
					In my role at Top Doctors, I focus on pioneering the development of chatbots tailored to empower patients in finding the most suitable healthcare specialists based on their specific needs. These chatbots utilize state-of-the-art NLP techniques to comprehend and respond to patients' inquiries in natural language, facilitating a user-friendly and efficient experience. Additionally, I am dedicated to providing intuitive explanations in natural language to healthcare specialists regarding the functionality of complex models. By bridging the gap between technical intricacies and practical healthcare applications, I aim to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of healthcare services, ultimately benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.
